FAQs about *ksrates*

Nextflow
========

If Nextflow crashes, where do I look for the error message?
-----------------------------------------------------------

When Nextflow crashes, an error message appears on the screen indicating which process exited the pipeline and reporting the error code. More details about the error that stopped the pipeline are stored in log files accessible in ``rate_adjustment/<focal_species>/log_XXXXXXXX``. The log folder name is unique for each run and is reported on the terminal at the beginning of a Nextflow run.


How do I update a previously downloaded *ksrates* pipeline if a new version becomes available?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::
   
    nextflow pull VIB-PSB/ksrates



Containers
==========

Containers take up quite some storage space, is this normal?
------------------------------------------------------------

Containers are known to be voluminous, especially Docker ones.

To keep Docker images, containers and volumes under control, you can delete the ones you donâ€™t need anymore by using the following commands:

    * Selectively delete images (``vibpsb/ksrates``)::

        docker image rm [image_ID]


    * Delete all containers/images and networks that are not in use::

        docker system prune -a 

.. TODO: why the vibpsb/ksrates here?
.. TODO: what are networks? is this important here?


To remove a Singularity container, remove its ``.img`` file. You can also check and clean the Singularity cache with::

    singularity cache clean [--dry-run]

General errors and warnings
===========================

The *K*:sub:`S` analysis step seems stuck.
------------------------------------------

*K*:sub:`S` analysis can take up to several hours, depending on the size of the genome, the size of the gene families, available resources, etc., and can look frozen when it doesn't output any of the ongoing operations. The building of the BLAST database and the gene family *K*:sub:`S` analyses can take quite some time. Particularly for paralog *K*:sub:`S` analyses, it can happen that even if the last gene family has been processed the analysis of more complex earlier gene families is still not complete.


What does "No codeml results for gene family [ID]" mean?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Nextflow ``wgd_paralogs.log`` file reports details over the *K*:sub:`S` analysis from the paralog or ortholog gene families. ``No codeml results for gene family [ID]...`` means that no *K*:sub:`S` estimates could be produced for that gene family.

Configuration
=============

How can I change the fit of the KDE line(s) on the paranome and anchor distributions?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjust the ``kde_bandwidth_modifier`` parameter in the expert configuration file (see :ref:`expert_config_section`).
